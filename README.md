An old school shmup game meant as a WebGL/HTML5 tech demo.

Collisions are done with the bounding boxes technique, a simple but very fast collisions detection algorithm whose [three.js implementation tutorial page on Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection/Bounding_volume_collision_detection_with_THREE.js) I contributed to, updating both the article and the code examples to the newest version of the three.js library. Feel free to learn from there how to implement it in your three.js game!

Currently on development, test from the website.
